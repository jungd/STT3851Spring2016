The Affordable Care Act (ACA) completed its second open enrollment period in February 2015. Assessing the law’s effects has major policy implications.Objectives
To estimate national changes in self-reported coverage, access to care, and health during the ACA’s first 2 open enrollment periods and to assess differences between low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not expand Medicaid.Design, Setting, and Participants
Analysis of the 2012-2015 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily national telephone survey. Using multivariable regression to adjust for pre-ACA trends and sociodemographics, we examined changes in outcomes for the nonelderly US adult population aged 18 through 64 years (n = 507 055) since the first open enrollment period began in October 2013. Linear regressions were used to model each outcome as a function of a linear monthly time trend and quarterly indicators. Then,  pre-ACA (January 2012-September 2013) and post-ACA (January 2014-March 2015) changes for adults with incomes below 138\% of the poverty level in Medicaid expansion states (n = 48 905 among 28 states and Washington, DC) vs nonexpansion states (n = 37 283 among 22 states) were compared using a differences-in-differences approach.Exposures
Beginning of the ACA’s first open enrollment period (October 2013).Main Outcomes and Measures
Self-reported rates of being uninsured, lacking a personal physician, lacking easy access to medicine, inability to afford needed care, overall health status, and health-related activity limitations.Results
Among the 507 055 adults in this survey, pre-ACA trends were significantly worsening for all outcomes. Compared with the pre-ACA trends, by the first quarter of 2015, the adjusted proportions who were uninsured decreased by 7.9 percentage points (95\% CI, −9.1 to −6.7); who lacked a personal physician, −3.5 percentage points (95\% CI, −4.8 to −2.2); who lacked easy access to medicine, −2.4 percentage points (95\% CI, −3.3 to −1.5); who were unable to afford care, −5.5 percentage points (95\% CI, −6.7 to −4.2); who reported fair/poor health, −3.4 percentage points (95\% CI, −4.6 to −2.2); and the percentage of days with activities limited by health, −1.7 percentage points (95\% CI, −2.4 to −0.9). Coverage changes were largest among minorities; for example, the decrease in the uninsured rate was larger among Latino adults (−11.9 percentage points [95\% CI, −15.3 to −8.5]) than white adults (−6.1 percentage points [95\% CI, −7.3 to −4.8]). Medicaid expansion was associated with significant reductions among low-income adults in the uninsured rate (differences-in-differences estimate, −5.2 percentage points [95\% CI, −7.9 to −2.6]), lacking a personal physician (−1.8 percentage points [95\% CI, −3.4 to −0.3]), and difficulty accessing medicine (−2.2 percentage points [95\% CI, −3.8 to −0.7]).Conclusions and Relevance
The ACA’s first 2 open enrollment periods were associated with significantly improved trends in self-reported coverage, access to primary care and medications, affordability, and health. Low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid reported significant gains in insurance coverage and access compared with adults in states that did not expand Medicaid.},

An important aspect of the ACA is that US companies may begin to offer health insurance incentives to employees for participating in health and wellness initiatives. Moreover, since US employers directly absorb many of the financial costs associated with the high degree of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors present in their personnel, employers may be financially vested in improving employee health. However, employers must also consider the costs of developing and maintaining programs to improve employee health and their return on investment (ROI). This review will identify key risk factors to address in a worksite health and wellness program and to examine the performance of such programs in improving CV risk factors and their ROI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medicare Part D increased economic access to medications, but its effect on population-level health outcomes and use of other medical services remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in health outcomes and medical services in the Medicare population after implementation of Part D.
DESIGN: Population-level longitudinal time-series analysis with generalized linear models.
SETTING: Community.
PATIENTS: Nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n = 56,293 [unweighted and unique]) from 2000 to 2010.
MEASUREMENTS: Changes in self-reported health status, limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) (ADLs and instrumental ADLs), emergency department visits and hospital admissions (prevalence, counts, and spending), and mortality. Medicare claims data were used for confirmatory analyses.
RESULTS: Five years after Part D implementation, no clinically or statistically significant reductions in the prevalence of fair or poor health status or limitations in ADLs or instrumental ADLs, relative to historical trends, were detected. Compared with trends before Part D, no changes in emergency department visits, hospital admissions or days, inpatient costs, or mortality after Part D were seen. Confirmatory analyses were consistent.
LIMITATIONS: Only total population-level outcomes were studied. Self-reported measures may lack sensitivity.
CONCLUSION: Five years after implementation, and contrary to previous reports, no evidence was found of Part D's effect on a range of population-level health indicators among Medicare enrollees. Further, there was no clear evidence of gains in medical care efficiencies.},

	abstract = {Objective
To examine the association between the increase in body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic factors (eg, income level, \% below poverty line, unemployment rates and persons receiving food stamps) in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and Colorado.

Design
Data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of Labor/ Bureau of Labor were obtained and analyzed for the years 1995–2008.

Results
Results from this study showed a strong association between obesity and the tested variables (R2=.767). Factors more closely related with obesity were: income below poverty level; receipt of food stamps; unemployment; and general income level. The coefficient of determination for these variables were 0.438, 0.427. 0.103 and 0.018, respectively. The highest rate of obesity was found in Mississippi (26.5\% ± 4.13\%) followed by Alabama (25.18\% ± 4.41\%), while Colorado had the lowest rate of obesity (15.4\% ± 2.63\%). By ethnicity, African Americans had the highest rate of obesity (32.64 ± 5.99\%).

Conclusion
We found a significant effect of consumption of low-quality food, due to economic factors, on increased BMI. Besides physical activity, the quality and the quantity of food are important factors that contribute to obesity rates.},

	abstract = {Objective

To evaluate whether aligning the Part D low-income subsidy and Medicaid program enrollment pathways in 2010 increased Medicaid participation among new Medicare beneficiaries.


Data Sources

Medicare enrollment records for years 2007–2011.


Study Design

We used a multinomial logistic model with state fixed effects to examine the annual change in limited and full Medicaid enrollment among new Medicare beneficiaries for 2 years before and after the reforms (2008–2011).


Data Extraction Methods

We identified new Medicare beneficiaries in the years 2008–2011 and their participation in Medicaid based on Medicare enrollment records.


Principal Findings

The percentage of beneficiaries enrolling in limited Medicaid at the start of Medicare coverage increased in 2010 by 0.3 percentage points for individuals aging into Medicare and by 1.3 percentage points for those qualifying due to disability (p {\textless} .001). There was no significant difference in the size of enrollment increases between states with and without concurrent limited Medicaid eligibility expansions.


Conclusions

Our findings suggest that streamlining financial assistance programs may improve Medicare beneficiaries’ access to benefits.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jpain.2012.03.009},
	abstract = {In 2008, according to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), about 100 million adults in the United States were affected by chronic pain, including joint pain or arthritis. Pain is costly to the nation because it requires medical treatment and complicates treatment for other ailments. Also, pain lowers worker productivity. Using the 2008 MEPS, we estimated 1) the portion of total U.S. health care costs attributable to pain; and 2) the annual costs of pain associated with lower worker productivity. We found that the total costs ranged from \$560 to \$635 billion in 2010 dollars. The additional health care costs due to pain ranged from \$261 to \$300 billion. This represents an increase in annual per person health care costs ranging from \$261 to \$300 compared to a base of about \$4,250 for persons without pain. The value of lost productivity due to pain ranged from \$299 to \$335 billion. We found that the annual cost of pain was greater than the annual costs of heart disease (\$309 billion), cancer (\$243 billion), and diabetes (\$188 billion). Our estimates are conservative because they do not include costs associated with pain for nursing home residents, children, military personnel, and persons who are incarcerated.
PERSPECTIVE: This study estimates that the national cost of pain ranges from \$560 to \$635 billion, larger than the cost of the nation's priority health conditions. Because of its economic toll on society, the nation should invest in research, education, and training to advocate the successful treatment, management, and prevention of pain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood Pressure related disease affected 118 million people in India in the year 2000; this figure will double by 2025. Around one in four adults in rural India have hypertension, and of those, only a minority are accessing appropriate care. Health systems in India face substantial challenges to meet these gaps in care, and innovative solutions are needed.
METHODS: We hypothesise that a multifaceted intervention involving capacity strengthening of primary healthcare doctors and non-physician healthcare workers through use of a mobile device-based clinical decision support system will result in improved blood pressure control for individuals at high risk of a cardiovascular disease event when compared with usual healthcare. This intervention will be implemented as a stepped wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial in 18 primary health centres and 54 villages in rural Andhra Pradesh involving adults aged ≥40 years at high cardiovascular disease event risk (approximately 15,000 people). Cardiovascular disease event risk will be calculated based on World Health Organisation/International Society of Hypertension's region-specific risk charts. Cluster randomisation will occur at the level of the primary health centres. Outcome analyses will be conducted blinded to intervention allocation.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES: The primary study outcome is the difference in the proportion of people meeting guideline-recommended blood pressure targets in the intervention period vs. the control period. Secondary outcomes include mean reduction in blood pressure levels; change in other cardiovascular disease risk factors, including body mass index, current smoking, reported healthy eating habits, and reported physical activity levels; self-reported use of blood pressure and other cardiovascular medicines; quality of life (using the EQ-5D); and cardiovascular disease events (using hospitalisation data). Trial outcomes will be accompanied by detailed process and economic evaluations.
SIGNIFICANCE: The findings are likely to inform policy on a scalable strategy to overcome entrenched inequities in access to effective healthcare for under-served populations in low and middle income country settings.

It also examines the extent to which obesity imposes negative externalities, and economic interventions that could potentially internalize such externalities, such as food taxes, subsidies for school-based physical activity programs, and financial rewards for weight loss. It discusses other economic rationales for government intervention with respect to obesity, such as imperfect information, time inconsistent preferences, and irrational behavior. It concludes by proposing a research agenda for the field. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no single dominant economic cause of obesity; a wide variety of factors may contribute a modest amount to the risk. There is consistent evidence regarding the economic consequences of obesity, which are lower wages and higher medical care costs that impose negative externalities through health insurance. Studies of economic approaches to preventing obesity, such as menu labeling, taxes on energy-dense foods, and financial rewards for weight loss find only modest effects on weight and thus a range of policies may be necessary to have a substantial effect on the prevalence of obesity.},

	abstract = {Poor diet quality is implicated in almost every disease and health issue. And yet, in most advanced market economies diet quality is poor, with a minority meeting guidelines for healthy eating. Poor diet is thus responsible for substantial disease burden. Societies have at their disposal a range of strategies to influence diet behaviors. These can be classified into: (i) population level socio-educational approaches to enhance diet knowledge; (ii) pricing incentives (subsidies on healthy foods, punitive taxes on unhealthy foods); (iii) regulations to modify the food environment, and (iv) the provision of clinical dietetic services. There is little evidence that societies are active in implementing the available strategies. Advertising of "junk foods" is largely unchecked, contrasting with strict controls on advertising tobacco products, which also attract punitive taxes. Access to dieticians is restricted in most countries, even in the context of universal health care. In Australia in 2011 there were just 2,969 practicing dieticians/nutritionists or 1.3 clinicians per 10,000 persons, compared with 5.8 physiotherapists per 10,000 persons, 14.8 general practitioners (family physicians) per 10,000 persons or 75 nurses per 10,000 persons. It is time to implement comprehensive national nutrition strategies capable of effecting change. Such strategies need to be multi-component, incorporating both public health approaches and expanded publicly funded dietetic services. Access to individualized dietetic services is needed by those at risk, or with current chronic conditions, given the complexity of the diet message, the need for professional support for behavior change and to reflect individual circumstances. The adoption of a comprehensive nutrition strategy offers the promise of substantial improvement in diet quality, better health and wellbeing and lower health care costs.;},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) completed its second open enrollment period in February 2015. Assessing the law's effects has major policy implications.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate national changes in self-reported coverage, access to care, and health during the ACA's first 2 open enrollment periods and to assess differences between low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not expand Medicaid.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of the 2012-2015 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily national telephone survey. Using multivariable regression to adjust for pre-ACA trends and sociodemographics, we examined changes in outcomes for the nonelderly US adult population aged 18 through 64 years (n = 507,055) since the first open enrollment period began in October 2013. Linear regressions were used to model each outcome as a function of a linear monthly time trend and quarterly indicators. Then, pre-ACA (January 2012-September 2013) and post-ACA (January 2014-March 2015) changes for adults with incomes below 138\% of the poverty level in Medicaid expansion states (n = 48,905 among 28 states and Washington, DC) vs nonexpansion states (n = 37,283 among 22 states) were compared using a differences-in-differences approach.
EXPOSURES: Beginning of the ACA's first open enrollment period (October 2013).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported rates of being uninsured, lacking a personal physician, lacking easy access to medicine, inability to afford needed care, overall health status, and health-related activity limitations.
RESULTS: Among the 507,055 adults in this survey, pre-ACA trends were significantly worsening for all outcomes. Compared with the pre-ACA trends, by the first quarter of 2015, the adjusted proportions who were uninsured decreased by 7.9 percentage points (95\% CI, -9.1 to -6.7); who lacked a personal physician, -3.5 percentage points (95\% CI, -4.8 to -2.2); who lacked easy access to medicine, -2.4 percentage points (95\% CI, -3.3 to -1.5); who were unable to afford care, -5.5 percentage points (95\% CI, -6.7 to -4.2); who reported fair/poor health, -3.4 percentage points (95\% CI, -4.6 to -2.2); and the percentage of days with activities limited by health, -1.7 percentage points (95\% CI, -2.4 to -0.9). Coverage changes were largest among minorities; for example, the decrease in the uninsured rate was larger among Latino adults (-11.9 percentage points [95\% CI, -15.3 to -8.5]) than white adults (-6.1 percentage points [95\% CI, -7.3 to -4.8]). Medicaid expansion was associated with significant reductions among low-income adults in the uninsured rate (differences-in-differences estimate, -5.2 percentage points [95\% CI, -7.9 to -2.6]), lacking a personal physician (-1.8 percentage points [95\% CI, -3.4 to -0.3]), and difficulty accessing medicine (-2.2 percentage points [95\% CI, -3.8 to -0.7]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The ACA's first 2 open enrollment periods were associated with significantly improved trends in self-reported coverage, access to primary care and medications, affordability, and health.

In this article we illustrate that this is true for a general class of estimators. Expressions for the minimum mean squared error and the relative efficiency are given for general distributions. The improvement, as measured by relative efficiency, is seen to be independent of the form of the distribution.},

	abstract = {The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes a major expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults in 2014. This paper describes the Oregon Health Study, a randomized controlled trial that will be able to shed some light on the likely effects of such expansions. In 2008, Oregon randomly drew names from a waiting list for its previously closed public insurance program. Our analysis of enrollment into this program found that people who signed up for the waiting list and enrolled in the Oregon Medicaid program were likely to have worse health than those who did not. However, actual enrollment was fairly low, partly because many applicants did not meet eligibility standards.},

	shorttitle = {An economy of scales},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jhealeco.2015.03.001},
	abstract = {This paper reviews the economic research on obesity, covering topics such as the measurement of, and trends in, obesity, the economic causes of obesity (e.g. the monetary price and time cost of food, food assistance programs, income, education, macroeconomic conditions, and peer effects), and the economic consequences of obesity (e.g. lower wages, a lower probability of employment, and higher medical care costs). It also examines the extent to which obesity imposes negative externalities, and economic interventions that could potentially internalize such externalities, such as food taxes, subsidies for school-based physical activity programs, and financial rewards for weight loss. It discusses other economic rationales for government intervention with respect to obesity, such as imperfect information, time inconsistent preferences, and irrational behavior. It concludes by proposing a research agenda for the field. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no single dominant economic cause of obesity; a wide variety of factors may contribute a modest amount to the risk. There is consistent evidence regarding the economic consequences of obesity, which are lower wages and higher medical care costs that impose negative externalities through health insurance. Studies of economic approaches to preventing obesity, such as menu labeling, taxes on energy-dense foods, and financial rewards for weight loss find only modest effects on weight and thus a range of policies may be necessary to have a substantial effect on the prevalence of obesity.},
